# Budabit Workflows Extension

A Flotilla Smart Widget extension that provides a full workflow management interface and artifact-attestation workflow for Nostr-native Git repositories. Users can view workflow run history, inspect live job status, trigger new runs, and co-sign artifact attestations — all powered by Nostr events and the Loom compute protocol.

## How It Works

### Nostr Event Architecture

The workflows extension is built entirely on Nostr events. There is no central CI server — workflow runs are represented as a chain of signed Nostr events published to relays, and remote workers pick up jobs via those same relays.

### Event Kinds

| Kind | Name | Direction | Purpose |
|------|------|-----------|---------|
| **5401** | Workflow Run | User → Relay | Declares a new CI run. Contains repo address (`#a`), workflow path, branch, commit, and triggering pubkey. Links to an ephemeral publisher key. |
| **5100** | Loom Job | User → Relay → Worker | Dispatches a compute job to a specific worker. References the 5401 run via `#e` tag. Contains the command, args, env vars, encrypted secrets, and a Cashu payment token. |
| **5402** | Workflow Result | Worker → Relay → User | Published by the runner script after `act` completes. Contains status (success/failed), duration, exit code, and a Blossom URL to the full act log. |
| **5101** | Loom Result | Worker → Relay → User | The Loom worker's own result event. Contains exit code, stdout/stderr Blossom URLs, and optionally a Cashu change token (refund for unused compute time). |
| **30100** | Loom Status | Worker → Relay → User | Replaceable status updates from the worker during execution (e.g., `queued`, `running`, `success`). |
| **10100** | Worker Advertisement | Worker → Relay | Workers advertise themselves with name, architecture, pricing, supported mints, and queue depth. The extension queries these to populate the worker picker. |
| **1063** | File Metadata (NIP-94) | Worker → Relay | Artifact attestations with SHA-256 hashes. Used by the attestation feature to verify artifact consensus across workers. |
| **30000** | People List (NIP-51) | User → Relay | Used to resolve trusted maintainer lists for artifact attestation co-signing. |

### Event Chain

When a user triggers a run, the extension creates two events in sequence:

1. **Kind 5401** (Workflow Run): Signed via the host's signer, published to the repo's relays. The signed event's `id` becomes the **run ID** — the primary identifier for the entire workflow execution.

2. **Kind 5100** (Loom Job): Also signed via the host. References the run ID in an `['e', runId]` tag. Contains:
   - `['p', workerPubkey]` — which worker should execute this
   - `['cmd', 'bash']` + `['args', ...]` — the runner script (inlined as a bash heredoc)
   - `['payment', cashuToken]` — prepaid Cashu token for the worker
   - `['env', key, value]` tags — environment variables (repo URL, branch, commit, relay list)
   - `['secret', key, encryptedValue]` tags — NIP-44 encrypted secrets (the ephemeral nsec, user-provided secrets)

The worker picks up the 5100 event, executes the command, and publishes status/result events back to the same relays.

### Artifact Attestation Trust Chain

The artifact-attestation feature establishes a trust chain from maintainers to build artifacts:

```
Maintainer (trusted pubkey)
  └── Kind 5401: links maintainer to ephemeral publisher key
        └── Kind 5100: links run to worker via p-tag
              └── Kind 10100: worker identity (name, architecture)
              └── Kind 1063: artifact with SHA-256 hash (published by ephemeral key)
```

The extension uses a two-phase data loading approach:
1. Fetch kind 5401 workflow runs → extract trusted ephemeral publisher keys
2. Fetch kind 1063 artifacts from those publisher keys

Artifacts are grouped by configurable tags (e.g., `filename`) and SHA-256 hashes are compared across workers. Consensus is classified as:
- **Unanimous** — all workers agree on the same hash
- **Majority** — more than half agree
- **Split** — no majority

Maintainers can then select artifacts and co-sign them via the host's event signer (`nostr:sign` bridge action), publishing their attestations to relays.

### Worker Discovery

Workers are discovered by querying **kind 10100** events from the repo's relays. Each worker advertisement contains:
- Name, description, architecture (e.g., `x86_64`)
- Supported `act` version
- Pricing (per-second rate, accepted Cashu mints)
- Queue depth and concurrency limits
- Online status (derived from recency of the advertisement)

Workers are sorted by online status and queue depth. The user selects a worker from the picker before submitting a run.

### Secrets and Encryption

The extension generates an **ephemeral keypair** for each run. The ephemeral secret key is NIP-44 encrypted to the worker's pubkey and passed as the `HIVE_CI_NSEC` secret. The runner script uses this nsec to:
- Upload the act log to Blossom (authenticated upload)
- Publish the kind 5402 workflow result event

User-provided secrets (e.g., API keys) are also NIP-44 encrypted to the worker and passed as `['secret', key, ciphertext]` tags.

All encryption is delegated to the host via the `nostr:nip44Encrypt` bridge handler — the extension never accesses `window.nostr` or any private key material directly.

### Payment Flow

Runs are prepaid with **Cashu tokens**. The extension:
1. Queries the user's Cashu wallet balance via the host bridge
2. Shows compatible mints (intersection of user's mints and worker's accepted mints)
3. Generates a Cashu token for the selected amount and mint
4. Includes the token in the 5100 event's `['payment', token]` tag

If the run finishes early, the worker may return a **change token** in the 5101 result event's `['change', token]` tag.

### Real-Time Updates

The extension uses **Nostr's native pub/sub** for live updates — no polling:

1. On load, it does a one-time `nostr:query` to fetch existing runs and their associated events.
2. It then opens a persistent `nostr:subscribe` WebSocket subscription filtering for kinds `[5401, 5100, 5402, 5101, 30100]` with the repo's `#a` tag.
3. Incoming events are **merged directly into local state** via `mergeEventIntoRuns()` / `mergeEventIntoDetail()` — no additional relay queries are triggered.
4. When viewing an active run, a second narrower subscription is opened with `#e` filters for the specific run and loom job IDs.

### Runner Script

The extension generates a **bash runner script** that is inlined into the loom job's args. The script:

1. Clones the Nostr repository using `ngit` (Nostr-native git)
2. Checks out the specified branch and commit
3. Runs GitHub Actions workflows using [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act)
4. Uploads the act log to Blossom (content-addressed storage)
5. Publishes a kind 5402 workflow result event with status, duration, and log URL

The script template is auto-generated based on the selected workflow, worker, and branch, but can be manually edited before submission.

### Host Bridge Integration

The extension runs as an iframe and communicates with Flotilla via the **Widget Bridge** protocol (`postMessage`-based). It delegates all privileged operations to the host:

| Bridge Action | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `nostr:query` | Fetch existing events from relays |
| `nostr:publish` | Sign unsigned events with the host's signer and publish to relays. Also publishes pre-signed events. Returns the signed event's `id`. |
| `nostr:sign` | Sign an event without publishing it. Used for attestation co-signing where the extension controls when to publish. Returns the full signed event. |
| `nostr:subscribe` | Open persistent WebSocket subscriptions. Events stream back via `nostr:subscription:event` bridge events. |
| `nostr:unsubscribe` | Close a previously opened subscription. |
| `nostr:nip44Encrypt` | Encrypt plaintext to a recipient pubkey using the host's NIP-44 signer. |
| `context:getRepo` | Fetch repository context (pubkey, name, naddr, relays). |
| `repo:listWorkflows` | List `.github/workflows/*.yml` files from the git repo. |
| `repo:getBranches` | Get branch list and default branch. |
| `storage:get/set/remove/keys` | Persist extension state (repo-scoped or global). |
| `cashu:getBalance` | Query the user's Cashu wallet balance (total and per-mint). |
| `cashu:getMints` | List the user's configured Cashu mints. |
| `cashu:createToken` | Generate a Cashu token from the user's wallet for a given amount and mint. |
| `ui:toast` | Show toast notifications in the host UI. |

The user's pubkey is provided by the host via `context:update` / `widget:init` events. The extension never uses `window.nostr` or NIP-07 directly — all signing is handled transparently by the host.

### Declared Permissions

The widget's kind 30033 manifest declares these permissions:

```
nostr:publish, nostr:query, nostr:sign, nostr:nip44Encrypt, nostr:subscribe, nostr:unsubscribe,
ui:toast, storage:get, storage:set, storage:remove, storage:keys,
context:getRepo, repo:listWorkflows, repo:getBranches,
cashu:getBalance, cashu:getMints, cashu:createToken
```

Flotilla enforces these — bridge requests for undeclared actions are rejected.

## Bridge Protocol

Flotilla uses an action-based `postMessage` protocol:

- **Widget → Host requests**: `{ type: 'request', id, action, payload }`
- **Host → Widget responses**: `{ type: 'response', id, action, payload }`
- **Host → Widget events**: `{ type: 'event', action, payload }`

The shared package provides a typed `WidgetBridge` with:
- `request(action, payload)` → `Promise<response>`
- `onEvent(action, handler)` — for host-initiated lifecycle events
- `onRequest(action, handler)` — for bidirectional tool interactions

### Lifecycle Events

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `widget:init` | Bridge ready, includes host version and optional repo context |
| `widget:mounted` | Widget is visible in the DOM |
| `widget:unmounting` | Widget is about to be removed |
| `context:update` / `context:repoUpdate` | Repository context changed (navigation) |
| `nostr:subscription:event` | Incoming Nostr event from a persistent subscription |
