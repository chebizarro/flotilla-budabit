# Self-Hosting Budabit

This is the no-BS path for running your own Budabit.

Budabit is a static SPA/PWA. You do not need to run your own email service, Anchor stack, or other backend just to get the app online.

The current architecture is community-first. A deployment can point at a default Communikey branch, but the deployment itself is not community identity. The branch identity is exactly `32222:<ownerPubkey>:<communityId>`, represented externally by its canonical definition `naddr`. That definition is authoritative for community metadata, relays, Blossom servers, ordered GRASP servers, Cashu mints, sections, and write-permission list references.

## Fast Path

Use Node.js 22 (Jod) and pnpm 10.12.4, matching `.nvmrc` and `package.json`.

```sh
git clone --branch master https://github.com/Pleb5/flotilla-budabit.git budabit
cd budabit
pnpm run build-in-production
```

Upload the contents of `build/` to your host.

That is enough for a basic deployment.

Releases, Pipelines, the template/SDK, core/UI, and Welshman source are tracked in
Budabit. The current monorepo has no Git submodules. Kanban lives in its
[own repository](https://grasp.budabit.club/npub16p8v7varqwjes5hak6q7mz6pygqm4pwc6gve4mrned3xs8tz42gq7kfhdw/budabit-kanban-extension.git)
and is not needed to clone, install, build, or test the host.

## Minimum `.env`

For a community-first deployment, create `.env` in the repo root. Use `.env.example` as the full reference. A practical deployment starts with:

```env
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
VITE_APP_NAME=Your Budabit
VITE_APP_ACCENT=#0f766e
VITE_APP_ACCENT_CONTENT=#ecfdf5
VITE_APP_LOGO=https://your-domain.com/logo.png
VITE_DEFAULT_COMMUNITY=naddr1...
VITE_INDEXER_RELAYS=wss://relay-1.example.com,wss://relay-2.example.com
VITE_SIGNER_RELAYS=wss://relay.damus.io,wss://nos.lol
VITE_GIT_RELAYS=wss://relay.ngit.dev,wss://gitnostr.com
```

Notes:

- `VITE_APP_URL` should be the final public URL of the app.
- `VITE_APP_NAME`, `VITE_APP_URL`, and `VITE_APP_LOGO` provide runtime app metadata. `VITE_APP_LOGO` is also used as the source for generated PWA assets.
- `VITE_APP_ACCENT`, `VITE_APP_ACCENT_CONTENT`, `VITE_APP_SECONDARY`, and `VITE_APP_SECONDARY_CONTENT` control the DaisyUI theme colors.
- `VITE_DEFAULT_COMMUNITY` should be the canonical `naddr` for an exact `kind:32222` definition. The pointer contains the owner, `communityId` identifier, and up to three definition-relay hints.
- `VITE_INDEXER_RELAYS` should include relays that can resolve the exact default `kind:32222` definition before the app knows that definition's own relays.
- `VITE_SIGNER_RELAYS` are used for NIP-46 signer discovery.
- `VITE_GIT_RELAYS` are used for top-level `/git` repository discovery and Git-related Nostr events. Community repository catalogs query authorized `kind:30617` announcements with exactly one matching `h=<communityId>`; repository targeting events are not currently supported.

`build.sh` currently post-processes generated HTML and `manifest.webmanifest` from `VITE_PLATFORM_NAME`, `VITE_PLATFORM_SHORT_NAME`, `VITE_PLATFORM_DESCRIPTION`, `VITE_PLATFORM_ACCENT`, and `VITE_PLATFORM_URL`. Set those too if you need install-card, Open Graph, and manifest metadata to differ from the built-in Budabit defaults. Runtime metadata still comes from `VITE_APP_*`.

Optional but useful for community media:

```env
VITE_DEFAULT_BLOSSOM_SERVERS=https://blossom-1.example.com,https://blossom-2.example.com
```

Community-specific Blossom servers should live in the community `kind:32222` definition. `VITE_DEFAULT_BLOSSOM_SERVERS` is a fallback, not community identity.

Optional widget discovery:

```env
VITE_SMART_WIDGET_RELAYS=wss://relay.budabit.club,wss://nos.lol
```

If this is empty, Budabit uses built-in widget relay defaults for direct widget lookups. Community defaults are loaded from the exact definition in `VITE_DEFAULT_COMMUNITY` and its `kind:30222` wrappers with adjacent stable community `h` and marked definition `a` tags. Only targeted `kind:30033` widgets authored by that community's owner become app-wide defaults.

To explicitly add default widgets from any author, set a comma-separated list of kind-30033 `naddr`s:

```env
VITE_DEFAULT_WIDGETS=naddr1...,naddr1...
```

This list is additive to community-owner defaults and also works with an empty `VITE_DEFAULT_COMMUNITY` or when community discovery fails. Leave it empty to rely only on community-owner defaults. Whitespace and empty entries are ignored; an optional `nostr:` prefix is accepted. Invalid entries and unavailable widgets are reported in the browser console without preventing other defaults from loading. Duplicate widget addresses are merged, including duplicates discovered through the community.

Explicit lookups try each address's relay hints first, then `VITE_SMART_WIDGET_RELAYS` (or the built-in relay defaults) if no usable widget is found. An `naddr` identifies a replaceable widget address, not a pinned release. Rebuild the deployment after changing this Vite variable; restart Vite for local development.

Defaults appear as installed and enabled. Users can disable them, and that preference is preserved across reloads, but cannot uninstall them while they remain defaults. Additional user-managed direct `naddr` installs live under Settings > Extensions > Advanced.

Explicit default addresses are recognized directly from configuration. Once a widget snapshot is cached locally or restored from synced settings, it is enabled immediately unless explicitly disabled, even while relay discovery is pending or unavailable. A first-time install still needs a successful manifest lookup.

To find or share an installed widget's address, open **Settings > Extensions > Details** on its card. The **Widget event link (naddr)** field is selectable, and the share icon copies it with relay hints and displays **Widget nostr link copied!**.

### Auditing relay defaults

`pnpm discover:relay-defaults` discovers and ranks community-first relay defaults
and writes evidence plus suggested Vite settings. Discovery is read-only by
default; its rankings do not establish write acceptance.

To explicitly test community write compatibility, supply a JSONL file containing
exactly one existing, signed `32222` event and one existing, signed `30222` event,
plus an active `nak-account` alias:

```sh
pnpm discover:relay-defaults -- --write-audit-events /path/to/signed-community-samples.jsonl --write-account five
```

The audit replays those exact events, preserving their authors, timestamps and
signatures. Its default destinations include shortlisted indexer/Git/widget
candidates, configured defaults, built-in widget defaults, community definition
relays, and discovered sample-author outboxes. Signer-only relays are excluded.
Repeat `--write-relay wss://relay.example/` to explicitly restrict destinations.
Start an inactive alias with `nak-account start <alias>` in a normal terminal.

The evidence and Markdown report include per-kind ACK outcomes, rejection reasons,
current-address readback of the exact event ID, and verified destinations by kind.
Timeouts and connection failures are inconclusive, not unsupported-kind evidence.
Acceptance applies to the sampled authors and payloads; it is not a guarantee for
every event of that kind. A duplicate ACK also does not prove fresh-event admission.
These explicit operator audits are separate from the application's local,
[ACK-learned write policy](../architecture/Relay-Publish-Outcomes.md#learned-write-kind-restrictions).

Optional trusted NIP-53 streaming providers:

```env
VITE_TRUSTED_LIVE_STREAM_PROVIDER_PUBKEYS=cf45a6ba1363ad7ed213a078e710d24115ae721c9b47bd1ebf4458eaefb4c2a5
```

When unset, Budabit trusts the provider pubkeys used by zap.stream. Setting this value replaces that default list. A trusted provider stream is accepted only when its kind `30311` event names a current community section moderator in a `p` tag with role `host` and carries the current community tag.

## Community Definition Checklist

Self-hosting Budabit does not create a community by itself. Before setting `VITE_DEFAULT_COMMUNITY`, make sure the exact branch has public Nostr state that Budabit can resolve:

- A valid `kind:32222` Communikey definition with `d=<communityId>`, authored by its owner
- Definition-native `name` and optional `description`, `picture`, `banner`, and `website` tags; the owner's personal `kind:0` is not community metadata
- `r` relay tags in the definition for community reads and writes
- `content`, `k`, and `a` tags for the sections you want to expose and their `kind:30000` profile-list write permissions
- Optional `blossom` tags for community-owned media storage
- Optional ordered `["grasp", "wss://..."]` tags for GRASP servers the community endorses or offers to members
- Optional `["service", "email-digest", <service-pubkey>, <request-relay>, <handler-address>, <handler-relay>]` tags for community-endorsed Git email digest providers
- Optional `["service", "community-alerts", <service-pubkey>, <request-relay>, <handler-address>, <handler-relay>]` tags for community-scoped member alert providers
- Optional `mint` tags for community Cashu mints
- Optional `g` tag for the community geohash; do not use `g` for GRASP servers

Community declarations do not automatically create or update user `kind:10063` Blossom lists, user `kind:10317` GRASP lists, or NIP-61 `kind:10019` Nutzap receiving configuration, and those events do not rewrite `kind:32222`. Budabit may recommend infrastructure declared by eligible, non-renounced communities, but the user must explicitly select **Add** before it becomes configured.

Relays are infrastructure, not identity. Do not configure a deployment as if one relay URL is the community. The app routes community state through `/c/<community-definition-naddr>`. Community-native events use stable `h=<communityId>`; authority-sensitive workflows also carry `a=<32222:owner:communityId>` with marker `community`. Never encode community association as `p=<communityId>`.

### Marketplace section and widgets

New-community defaults include **Marketplace** with services `32765`, orders `32766`, jobs `32767`, proposals `32768`, reviews `1986`, and NIP-99 classified listings `30402`, all with empty subtypes. For an existing branch, its owner can choose **Add Marketplace** when the kinds are unassigned, or rename the existing Freelance section to Marketplace and add `30402`. Configure the section's profile-list grants and publish the updated definition. Deploying a newer app does not update that signed definition automatically.

The workspace is a separately published Smart Widget: target its kind-30033 manifest to the exact branch using kind 30222 under Widget-curator access. The current Community Freelance widget signs through the host and directly reads/writes the definition's relays. Its thumbnails use community Blossom first, then personal/widget-build fallback. Configure the widget's own `VITE_DEFAULT_BLOSSOM_SERVERS` when building it if you want it to match the host deployment's fallback; the bridge does not pass the host's personal/default upload settings. See [Community Freelance](../features/freelance.md) for setup and the full kind list.

The separately published Community Classifieds widget shares the Marketplace section's grants for `30402`, uses host-authorized reads and host signing, and publishes directly to the community relays. Its current drafts are local; `30403` is not required. Images upload to the signed definition's Blossom servers.

## Email Digests

In-app badges and notification sounds are always available. Git email digest providers are not configured through deployment variables. A branch owner advertises a provider in the signed `kind:32222` definition, and each user explicitly selects one endorsed provider in Settings > Notifications.

The provider receives the user's encrypted subscription on its declared request relay. Removing a service declaration does not transfer existing users to another provider; Budabit preserves their selected snapshot so they can disable the old registration.

Community alert discovery is stricter and remains per-branch: Budabit considers only the current verified event at each exact `kind:32222` definition address for member, moderator, or owner branches, and never combines the same provider across branches. Provider identity is the service pubkey's signed `kind:0` profile; the handler pubkey is not provider identity.

For community alerts, clients publish a NIP-44 encrypted `kind:32830` event with exact tags `d=budabit/community-alerts/<community>` and `p=<service-pubkey>` to the selected request relay. Providers return per-user encrypted `kind:32831` status at `d=budabit/community-alerts/<community>/<user>` and `p=<user>`, including an `ineligible` state when Anchor rejects eligibility. Client preferences and exact endpoint snapshots live separately from Git settings in a self-encrypted `kind:30078` event with `d=budabit/community-alerts-settings`. Switching providers deletes the old endpoint before registering the new one.

## Optional Account Service

Budabit does not need an account backend for normal Nostr-signer use. If you run a hosted email/password account service, set:

```env
VITE_BURROW_URL=https://your-burrow.example.com
```

Leave it empty to hide those flows.

## Hosting Requirements

Any static host is fine if it can do SPA fallback.

Requirements:

- Serve the app from the domain root, like `https://your-domain.com/`
- Rewrite unknown routes to `/index.html`
- Do not strip the generated `.htaccess` if you use LiteSpeed or Apache

### Apache / LiteSpeed

The generated `build/.htaccess` already handles:

- SPA rewrites
- cache rules for hashed assets
- no-cache/no-store for `service-worker.js`, `sw.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, and `_app/version.json`
- CORS headers for `/.well-known/`

If you are on Apache, retain the generated `.htaccess`, but deploy the `build/` contents with the ordered deployment command below. Do not replace the remote directory with one parallel upload.

On shared hosting, prefer Apache/PHP-FPM over OpenLiteSpeed for Budabit unless you have verified the headers below. We have seen OpenLiteSpeed/LSCache serve correct files while ignoring or overriding `.htaccess` `Header` and `AddType` rules. Symptoms include `/settings` returning `200`, but `service-worker.js` and `sw.js` still getting a positive `max-age`, `manifest.webmanifest` being served as `application/octet-stream`, and `/_app/immutable/*` missing the long immutable cache header.

If your host has these toggles, use:

- Apache/PHP-FPM enabled
- LSCache disabled
- Force HTTPS/SSL enabled

Some shared hosts override or ignore parts of `.htaccess`. After deployment, verify the live headers:

```sh
node scripts/check-deploy-cache.mjs https://your-domain.com
```

If this fails, fix the hosting-panel cache rules before trusting app updates. `.htaccess` changes normally apply immediately; repeated failures usually mean the web server or host-level cache is ignoring or overriding those directives.

### Other Static Hosts

Set the equivalent rule:

- if request matches a real file, serve it
- otherwise serve `/index.html`

If your host cannot do SPA fallback, direct links like `/settings`, `/git/...`, or `/c/...` will break.

## Container Runtime

The included Dockerfile builds the static app and serves `build/` with `serve` in SPA mode.

```sh
podman build -t budabit .
podman run -d --name budabit -p 1847:1847 budabit
```

The runtime image defaults to `PORT=1847`. Override it if needed:

```sh
podman run -d --name budabit -e PORT=3000 -p 3000:3000 budabit
```

## Frequent Updates

For a deployment checkout without local source commits (keep branding in `.env`):

```sh
git pull --ff-only
pnpm run build-in-production
```

Then use the ordered deployment procedure below. Uploading `build/` as one parallel mirror does not preserve the atomic update contract.

For local source commits or checkouts predating the submodule-to-directory
migration, follow [Updating and Migrating Older Checkouts](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-and-migrating-older-checkouts).
Legacy template-pointer commits must be migrated to ordinary source changes.

## Deploying with SFTP/LFTP (Recommended Strategy)

If you deploy with `lftp mirror -R --delete` over SFTP, be aware of one important detail:

- Budabit emits cache-busted assets under `/_app/immutable/*`.
- Filenames are content-hashed, so each new build creates new names.
- `--delete` removes old hash files one-by-one on the remote host.

If you deploy often, this can create very long delete phases as old immutable files accumulate.

### Why this happens

- **Hashed immutable assets are intentional.** They let browsers cache files safely for a long time.
- **Users do not download every file in `/_app/immutable`.** Browsers request only the files referenced by the current `index.html` plus route chunks needed for navigation.
- **Delete storms are a deployment-side cost.** SFTP deletes are still per-file operations, so removing thousands of old hashes is slow even when transfer size is small.

### Recommended approach

Use the ordered deploy wrapper after building:

```sh
pnpm run build-in-production
BUDABIT_SFTP_HOST='sftp://example.com' \
BUDABIT_SFTP_USER='your-user' \
BUDABIT_REMOTE_PATH='.' \
./scripts/deploy-static-lftp.sh
```

The script prompts for the SFTP password with `read -rsp` unless `LFTP_PASSWORD` is already set. Do not put passwords in command arguments.

For less typing, create an untracked `.deploy.local.env`:

```sh
BUDABIT_SFTP_HOST='sftp://example.com'
BUDABIT_SFTP_USER='your-user'
BUDABIT_REMOTE_PATH='.' # e.g. '/public_html'
BUDABIT_DEPLOY_VERIFY_URL='https://example.com'
```

Then normal deploys are:

```sh
pnpm run build-in-production
./scripts/deploy-static-lftp.sh
```

For the main Budabit deployment, the one-command wrapper builds with
`https://budabit.club`, disables performance diagnostics, and runs the same
ordered publisher using `.deploy.local.env`:

```sh
pnpm run deploy:main
```

Set `BUDABIT_MAIN_DEPLOY_CONFIG` to use a different local deployment config.

To publish an already validated `build/` directory without rebuilding, use
`pnpm deploy:main:built` or `pnpm deploy:test:built`. These commands verify the
service-worker contract and reject output configured for the other site.

The wrapper runs six ordered phases:

1. Upload new `/_app/immutable/*` files without deleting old immutable files.
2. Publish a deployment sentinel so no worker can install while shared files change.
3. Upload supporting mutable files with delete enabled, excluding immutable files, the worker, shell, and marker.
4. Upload `service-worker.js` after every file it may cache is available.
5. Upload `index.html` after the matching worker is available.
6. Upload `/_app/version.json` last so the worker cannot install before the release is complete.

For worker, shell, and marker files, the wrapper uploads a complete temporary file, removes the old destination, and renames the temporary file into place. This works with SFTP servers that do not support rename-over-existing; a request may briefly see a missing file, but never a partially uploaded one.

Preview the generated lftp commands without connecting:

```sh
./scripts/deploy-static-lftp.sh --dry-run
```

Notes:

- Do **not** add `--delete-excluded` to the mutable pass, or excluded immutable files may be removed.
- If your SFTP server is unstable, set `BUDABIT_LFTP_PARALLEL=2` or `BUDABIT_LFTP_PARALLEL=4`.
- Set `BUDABIT_DEPLOY_VERIFY_URL` to run the release and cache-header checks automatically after deployment, or run `node scripts/check-deploy-cache.mjs https://your-domain.com` manually.

### Remote storage growth and cleanup

Because immutable files are not deleted on every deploy, remote storage will grow over time. That is expected.

Recommended policy:

- Keep fast, safe deploys day-to-day with `scripts/deploy-static-lftp.sh`.
- Run cleanup only in a low-traffic maintenance window after your retention window has passed.
- Keep at least the current and previous build's immutable files. Pass the previous build directory with `--keep-build-dir` when you have it archived.
- Browser Cache Storage cleanup is automatic: the service worker keeps the current and previous `budabit-app-*` caches.

Preview remote immutable cleanup first. Dry-run is the default:

```sh
./scripts/cleanup-static-lftp.sh --dry-run --keep-build-dir /path/to/previous-build
```

Apply only after reviewing the dry-run output:

```sh
./scripts/cleanup-static-lftp.sh --apply --keep-build-dir /path/to/previous-build
```

The cleanup script only targets `/_app/immutable/`; it does not touch mutable app files or `/_app/version.json`.

## External Runtime Dependencies

Budabit is static, but it still talks to public network services from the browser:

- Nostr relays from `VITE_INDEXER_RELAYS`, `VITE_GIT_RELAYS`, user relay lists, and the active community definition
- Blossom servers from user settings, the active community definition, and optional fallback env values
- Git HTTP remotes, usually through a CORS proxy
- Dufflepud at `https://dufflepud.onrender.com`, currently wired as the Welshman backend service URL and used for link preview service calls
- Optional Burrow account service if `VITE_BURROW_URL` is set
- Community-endorsed Git digest and community alert providers selected by individual users

Git-over-HTTP operations use a CORS proxy. If you do not set one, Budabit falls back to `https://corsproxy.budabit.club`.

If you want to be fully independent, set your own:

```env
VITE_GIT_DEFAULT_CORS_PROXY=https://your-cors-proxy.example.com
```

## Things That Will Bite You

- Do not deploy under a subfolder unless you plan to rework base-path assumptions.
- Use the root workspace and lockfile for installs; current revisions need no submodule initialization.
- Do not use a dumb file server without SPA rewrites and expect deep links to work.
- Do not point `VITE_DEFAULT_COMMUNITY` at a user profile, raw pubkey, `npub`, or `ncommunity`; use a resolvable exact `kind:32222` definition `naddr`.
- Do not rely on legacy `/spaces/[relay]` routes. They were removed in the Communikey pivot.
- Do not expect Git email delivery unless an eligible community advertises a provider and the user explicitly enables it.

## Sanity Check

Before uploading, this should work locally:

```sh
npx serve -s build -p 3000
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` and test a deep route directly.
