# Enabled Features Summary

This document records the current build-time feature defaults and built-in extension status. For the full feature flag reference, see `docs/features/FEATURE_FLAGS.md`.

## Current Feature Flag Defaults

The root `vite.config.ts` defines these compile-time flags from environment variables. `.env.example` carries the recommended defaults.

| Environment variable  | Compile-time constant | Default                    | Current role                          |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `FEATURE_GRASP`       | `__GRASP__`           | Enabled unless set to `0`  | GRASP and Nostr Git integration.      |
| `FEATURE_CICD`        | `__CICD__`            | Disabled unless set to `1` | Experimental CI/CD automation hooks.  |
| None | `__IMPORT_REPO__` | Always disabled | Retired alternative history importer; environment cannot enable it. |

## Community Architecture Note

Budabit's current community architecture is Communikey-based:

- A branch is identified by the exact definition address `32222:<owner>:<communityId>` and its canonical `naddr`; `communityId` remains the stable `d` and community-event `h` value.
- Community routes are under `/c/[community]`, with the definition `naddr` as `[community]`.
- Canonical Git routes are under `/git`.
- Relay URLs are infrastructure and discovery hints, not community IDs.
- Community metadata comes from definition tags, not the owner's personal `kind:0` profile, and community association is never encoded as a person `p` tag.

NIP-34 pull request support is always part of Budabit. Terminal UI has been removed for now. Strict NIP-29 validation is not part of the current community access-control model; current write permissions come from community definition sections and their referenced `kind:30000` profile lists.

## Default Community Sections

New communities and **Restore defaults** include General, Room-creator, Thread-creator, Calendar-event-creator, Fundraiser-goals-creator, Code-curator, Widget-curator, and **Marketplace**. Marketplace combines services `32765`, orders `32766`, jobs `32767`, proposals `32768`, QTS reviews `1986`, and NIP-99 classified listings `30402` in one section.

This is section configuration, not a build-time feature flag or bundled widget. Existing communities need an owner-published definition update; **Add Marketplace** adds the preset without resetting other sections when its kinds are unassigned. An existing Freelance section can be renamed to Marketplace and extended with `30402`. See [Community Marketplace and Freelance](freelance.md) for grants, widget targeting, workflows, and media setup.

## Default Community Extensions

Budabit does not bundle extension code, but it does load default extensions curated by the configured default community.

`src/app/extensions/builtin.ts` resolves the exact `kind:32222` definition `naddr` in `VITE_DEFAULT_COMMUNITY` and loads `kind:30033` widgets targeted through `kind:30222` wrappers whose stable `h=<communityId>` is immediately followed by the marked exact definition `a`.

Default community extensions appear in Settings > Extensions as installed and enabled. Users can disable them, but cannot uninstall them because they come from community curation rather than user-installed storage.

Additional extensions are installed through community-curated `kind:30033` discovery or direct Smart Widget `naddr` values from Settings > Extensions.

## Optional Extension Packages

The repo contains `packages/budabit-releases-extension`,
`packages/budabit-pipelines-extension`, and `packages/flotilla-extension-template`
as in-tree workspaces for development and distribution. They share the root
install and local SDK, but are not automatically enabled in the app bundle.

Kanban is maintained in a [standalone repository](https://grasp.budabit.club/npub16p8v7varqwjes5hak6q7mz6pygqm4pwc6gve4mrned3xs8tz42gq7kfhdw/budabit-kanban-extension.git).
It is not a Budabit submodule, workspace, or test project. Published Kanban widgets
can still use the host's normal Smart Widget installation and bridge APIs.

Run or publish those packages according to their package-level docs when you want to test or distribute them.
