# Budabit Community Architecture

This document describes Budabit's community architecture after the pivot from relay-as-community to Communikeys.

Budabit treats this as a clean redesign of the community foundation. Legacy relay spaces, relay URL identity, and NIP-29 room metadata are not part of the model.

## Summary

Budabit communities are identified by a pubkey.

The community pubkey publishes a `kind:10222` Communikey definition event. That event is authoritative for the community's relays and other infrastructure, including Blossom, ordered GRASP, and Cashu mint declarations, as well as supported content sections, profile lists used for write permissions, and optional badge references for engagement.

Relays are infrastructure. They are not identity.

The selected community is the root of the application session. A user may enter either an `npub` or an `ncommunity` value. `ncommunity` provides relay hints, but bare `npub` must be enough.

## Core Principles

| Principle                 | Decision                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Community identity        | The community pubkey is the canonical durable identifier.                                                                                           |
| Relay identity            | Relay URLs are never community IDs. They are relay hints and publication targets.                                                                   |
| Session scope             | A Budabit session stores the selected community pubkey and optional relay hints.                                                                    |
| Community visibility      | Budabit admits permission-governed content under current section grants. Matching events may remain publicly retrievable from relays.               |
| Write access              | Profile lists are the effective write-permission source.                                                                                            |
| User-community membership | App-wide membership is derived from community definitions plus section profile lists: admin, moderator/list owner, or member/grantee.               |
| Badges                    | Badges drive engagement and endorsements; profile list inclusion is what Budabit enforces for write access.                                         |
| Rooms                     | Rooms are immutable `kind:11` roots with a `room` marker.                                                                                           |
| Room messages             | Room messages are `kind:9` chat events scoped to the community and room root.                                                                       |
| Threads                   | Threads remain `kind:11`, distinguished from rooms by absence of a `room` marker.                                                                   |
| Global chat               | There is no global community chat. Every chat message belongs to a room.                                                                            |
| Targeted publications     | Calendar events, goals, repo announcements, permalinks, and smart widgets use `kind:30222`.                                                         |
| Exclusive content         | Rooms, room messages, threads, comments, reactions, labels, deletes, reports, profile data, badges, forms, and lists are not targeted publications. |
| Migration                 | This is a clean break. Legacy relay-space architecture is not preserved as a compatibility layer.                                                   |

## Community Resolution

Budabit should offer an input field labelled along these lines:

```text
Community npub or ncommunity
```

Resolution flow:

1. Parse input as `ncommunity`, `npub`, or raw hex pubkey.
2. Extract the community pubkey.
3. Extract relay hints if the input is `ncommunity`.
4. Fetch the latest `kind:10222` event authored by the community pubkey.
5. Fetch the community `kind:0` profile metadata.
6. Fetch profile lists referenced by the `kind:10222` content sections.
7. Build the active community model from the community pubkey and latest valid definition.

Bare `npub` resolution should use best-effort discovery through bootstrap relays, indexer relays, outbox discovery, and eventually any relays found from prior cache state.

## Session Model

The session must persist community identity separately from user identity.

Suggested shape:

```json
{
  "userPubkey": "<logged-in-user-pubkey>",
  "communityPubkey": "<selected-community-pubkey>",
  "communityRelayHints": ["wss://relay.example.com"],
  "communityDefinitionId": "<latest-kind-10222-id>"
}
```

`userPubkey` answers who is using Budabit.

`communityPubkey` answers which community Budabit is currently viewing.

Guests can select a community and read content that passes Budabit's current community admission rules. Logged-in users can publish only when they satisfy the section's write rules.

## Community Definition

Budabit communities are defined by `kind:10222` events authored by the community pubkey.

The community profile name, picture, and default description come from the community pubkey's `kind:0` metadata event. A `description` tag in `kind:10222` can override the profile description for Budabit community display.

Example target shape:

```json
{
  "kind": 10222,
  "pubkey": "<community-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["r", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["r", "wss://backup.community.relay"],
    ["blossom", "https://blossom.community.example"],
    ["grasp", "wss://preferred.grasp.example"],
    ["grasp", "wss://backup.grasp.example"],
    ["mint", "https://mint.community.example", "cashu"],
    ["g", "u4pruydqqvj"],

    ["content", "General"],
    ["k", "1111"],
    ["k", "7"],
    ["k", "1985"],
    ["k", "9", "room-message"],
    ["a", "30000:<list-pubkey>:General-1", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["a", "30000:<list-pubkey>:General-2", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["badge", "30009:<issuer-pubkey>:member"],

    ["content", "Room-creator"],
    ["k", "11", "room"],
    ["a", "30000:<list-pubkey>:Room-creator", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["badge", "30009:<issuer-pubkey>:room-admin"],

    ["content", "Thread-creator"],
    ["k", "11", "threads"],
    ["a", "30000:<list-pubkey>:Thread-creator", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["badge", "30009:<issuer-pubkey>:member"],

    ["content", "Calendar-event-creator"],
    ["k", "31922"],
    ["a", "30000:<list-pubkey>:Calendar-event-creator", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["badge", "30009:<issuer-pubkey>:member"],

    ["content", "Fundraiser-goals-creator"],
    ["k", "9041"],
    ["a", "30000:<list-pubkey>:Fundraiser-goals-creator", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["badge", "30009:<issuer-pubkey>:member"],

    ["content", "Code-curator"],
    ["k", "30617"],
    ["k", "1623"],
    ["a", "30000:<list-pubkey>:Code-curator", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["badge", "30009:<issuer-pubkey>:code-curator"],

    ["content", "Widget-curator"],
    ["k", "30033"],
    ["a", "30000:<list-pubkey>:Widget-curator", "wss://main.community.relay"],
    ["badge", "30009:<issuer-pubkey>:widget-curator"]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```

Repeated `["grasp", "wss://..."]` tags are ordered: they declare, in preference order, GRASP servers that the community endorses or offers to members. The `g` tag remains the community geohash and must not be interpreted as a GRASP server.

A user's `kind:10063` Blossom list describes that user's blob hosts, while `kind:10317` describes that user's preferred GRASP servers. NIP-61 `kind:10019` is Nutzap receiving configuration rather than a generic mint list; Budabit may use its mint tags as person-level recommendation evidence. These events are not community infrastructure authority, and Budabit does not automatically dual-publish them from `kind:10222`. A declaration from an eligible, non-renounced community is viable recommendation evidence, but applying a recommendation always requires an explicit **Add** action.

The third value in a `k` tag is a Budabit subtype convention. It is needed when one event kind supports more than one community section.

| Tag                          | Meaning in Budabit           |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `["k", "11", "room"]`        | `kind:11` room roots.        |
| `["k", "11", "threads"]`     | `kind:11` thread roots.      |
| `["k", "9", "room-message"]` | `kind:9` room chat messages. |

Each exact `(kind, subtype)` pair should appear in only one section per community definition. Empty subtype is exact and does not match non-empty subtypes. This lets publish gates, application forms, and member grants resolve to one section without fallback or wildcard behavior.

Section names and their profile-list references are part of the permission lifecycle. Admin edits that rename a section, move a `(kind, subtype)` pair, or remove a section should be treated as dangerous changes. Budabit warns immediately while editing, then summarizes migration effects before publishing.

When migration is selected, Budabit publishes and verifies replacement permission updates before publishing the new community definition. Granted members are merged into a new admin-owned list for destination sections. Moderators must accept new destination-section permissions. Active forms may be copied by the admin. Pending requests, applicant submissions, and user-authored reports are not copied.

### Profile-list sharding

A section may contain repeated `a` tags with distinct `kind:pubkey:d` coordinates. Budabit loads each exact coordinate and treats the union of the current `p` tags as the section grant set. This allows large sections to stay within relay event-size and tag-count limits instead of requiring one unbounded `kind:30000` event.

Each shard remains independently replaceable by its coordinate author. Missing shard evidence contributes no `p`-tag grants or moderator authority. A non-admin shard owner still receives the app's structural community-wide member/write access while the latest definition references that coordinate.

## Access Control

Budabit uses Communikey grants for both publish permission and client-side community visibility. This is curation, not confidentiality: relays may serve the underlying signed events to other clients, and Budabit does not rely on relays to enforce section policy.

Permission workflow:

1. Read the active community's latest `kind:10222` definition.
2. Find the content section for the attempted publication.
3. Fetch every exact `kind:30000` coordinate referenced by the section.
4. Union their current `p` tags, include structural member access for referenced non-admin list owners, and include moderator authority only for coordinates with a current non-declined list event.
5. Allow publishing or community rendering only when the relevant author has a current grant and the event passes structural validation.

Badges remain important as community endorsements and engagement primitives, but they are not access-control inputs. For Budabit enforcement, profile list inclusion is authoritative.

The same current grants govern historical and live content. A revocation hides an author's previously visible direct content and targeting wrappers without deleting those events from relays. A regrant invalidates the old admission state and restarts structural acquisition, allowing matching history to be refetched and reappear. Budabit does not preserve a separate “was authorized when published” grant for normal community views.

If the definition or relay read is incomplete, Budabit fails closed. A complete read that finds no target-owned moderator list is settled evidence of a pending invitation, not a loading failure.

## App-Wide User Community Membership

Budabit should derive a canonical app-wide list of communities the active user is part of. Feature-specific systems such as Blossom must consume that list instead of re-implementing their own community-membership rules.

A user is part of a community when at least one of these is true:

- Admin: the latest `kind:10222` definition is authored by the user.
- Moderator: a section in `kind:10222` references a `kind:30000` profile-list address owned by the user, and Budabit has seen that user-authored `kind:30000` event.
- Invited list owner/member: the latest definition references a non-admin `kind:30000` coordinate owned by the user. Missing and declined responses retain community-wide member/write access while the reference remains, but confer no moderator, grant, or report-review authority.
- Member/grantee: a referenced section profile-list event contains a `p` tag for the user.

Non-admin users are excluded when effective community report state contains a person-ban for that user. The community admin is never excluded by a person-ban in their own community.

Discovery should keep `kind:30000` profile-list events as a first-class entrypoint. If the user-authored profile list includes an `a` tag pointing to `10222:<community-pubkey>:` with a relay hint, Budabit may use that relay hint to find the community definition. Budabit should still validate the role against the loaded `kind:10222` section refs before treating the user as a moderator.

Community-scoped data used to validate membership, including referenced section profile lists and moderation reports, should be loaded from the relays declared by the loaded `kind:10222` definition. Personal outbox and indexer relays may help discover root `kind:10222` definitions, but they are not fallback sources for scoped membership or moderation state.

## Badge Display And Access Revocation

NIP-58 badge awards are immutable `kind:8` events. The NIP-58 text defines how badges are created, awarded, and displayed, but it does not define a standard revocation event that deletes or invalidates a badge award.

NIP-58 users can choose whether to display badges through their profile badge event. That is user-side acceptance/display, not issuer-side revocation.

For Budabit section access, effective revocation is profile-list removal:

```json
{
  "kind": 30000,
  "pubkey": "<list-manager-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "General"],
    ["p", "<still-allowed-pubkey>"]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```

When a user is removed from every shard in the relevant section's current profile-list union, Budabit must treat that user as no longer allowed to publish or remain visible as a section author, even if an old badge award event still exists. Removing the user from only one shard does not revoke a grant that remains in another current shard.

Admin tooling that grants or revokes access must update profile lists. Badge awards may be published separately as recognition or onboarding context, but they are not effective permission state:

| Action           | Badge event                                | Profile list event                    | Effective result                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Grant access     | Optional endorsement award                 | Add pubkey to a section shard         | User can publish.                        |
| Revoke access    | Existing badge award remains display state | Remove pubkey from all section shards | User cannot publish.                     |
| User hides badge | User updates profile badges                | No required change                    | Display changes, write access unchanged. |

If a future standard defines explicit badge revocation, Budabit can support it for badge display and engagement. Profile lists remain the access-control source of truth unless Budabit intentionally adopts another permission signal.

## Targeted Publications

Budabit uses `kind:30222` for public publications that can be associated with one or more communities.

Targeted kinds:

|    Kind | Feature             |
| ------: | ------------------- |
| `31922` | Calendar events.    |
|  `9041` | Fundraiser goals.   |
| `30617` | Repo announcements. |
|  `1623` | Git permalinks.     |
| `30033` | Smart widgets.      |

Budabit convention:

| Field                        | Meaning                                                               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Original publication `h` tag | Targeting identifier, not community pubkey.                           |
| Targeting event `d` tag      | Same targeting identifier used in the original publication's `h` tag. |
| Targeting event `p` tags     | Community pubkeys being targeted.                                     |
| Targeting event `r` tags     | Main relay hints for the corresponding communities.                   |

This preserves a strict split:

| `h` value         | Used by                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `communityPubkey` | Exclusive community-native content.                      |
| `targeting d/id`  | Targetable publications associated through `kind:30222`. |

The wrapper author is the community-facing authority. Budabit discovers wrappers by `#p = communityPubkey` and `#k = originalKind`, then admits only wrappers whose signer has the current section grant. An explicit `e` reference may identify an external-author original by exact event ID. An explicit `a` reference may identify an external-author original by its exact coordinate, retaining that coordinate's author and `#d`. Without either reference, the original is implicit and must have `h = targeting d` and the same signer as the admitted wrapper.

Example targeted calendar publication:

```json
{
  "kind": 31922,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "calendar-event-id"],
    ["h", "targeting-calendar-event-id"],
    ["title", "Demo Day"],
    ["start", "1770000000"],
    ["end", "1770003600"]
  ],
  "content": "Event details"
}
```

Example targeting event:

```json
{
  "kind": 30222,
  "tags": [
    ["d", "targeting-calendar-event-id"],
    ["a", "31922:<author-pubkey>:calendar-event-id", "wss://author-relay.example"],
    ["k", "31922"],
    ["p", "<community-pubkey>"],
    ["r", "wss://main.community.relay"]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```

Budabit should support one selected community in the first implementation, but the targeting model should allow up to 12 communities per targeted publication later.

## Target Removal

Targeting is mutable through the addressable `kind:30222` event.

To remove a publication from a community, publish a newer `kind:30222` with the same `d` tag and without that community's `p`/`r` pair.

The original publication is not deleted or modified.

## Exclusive Community Content

Exclusive community-native content uses `h = communityPubkey`.

Exclusive content includes rooms, room messages, threads, comments that naturally belong to roots, reactions, labels, deletes, and reports.

Example exclusive thread:

```json
{
  "kind": 11,
  "tags": [
    ["h", "<community-pubkey>"],
    ["title", "Thread topic"]
  ],
  "content": "Thread body"
}
```

Example thread reply:

```json
{
  "kind": 1111,
  "tags": [
    ["E", "<thread-event-id>", "wss://main.community.relay", "<thread-author-pubkey>"],
    ["K", "11"],
    ["P", "<thread-author-pubkey>", "wss://main.community.relay"]
  ],
  "content": "Reply body"
}
```

## Rooms

Rooms are immutable `kind:11` root events.

The canonical room ID is the room root event ID.

Room root example:

```json
{
  "kind": 11,
  "tags": [["h", "<community-pubkey>"], ["room"], ["title", "General"]],
  "content": "Room description"
}
```

Room root rules:

| Rule            | Decision                                                  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kind            | `11`.                                                     |
| Community scope | `h = communityPubkey`.                                    |
| Room marker     | Include a `room` tag.                                     |
| Title           | Use NIP-7D `title`.                                       |
| Description     | Use `content`.                                            |
| Mutability      | Immutable. Create a new room if identity needs to change. |
| Canonical ID    | Event ID.                                                 |
| URL identity    | No relay URL in canonical ID.                             |

Thread roots are also `kind:11`, but they do not include a `room` tag.

## Room Messages

Room messages are NIP-C7 chat events using `kind:9`.

A room message must be scoped to both the community and the room root:

```json
{
  "kind": 9,
  "tags": [
    ["h", "<community-pubkey>"],
    ["E", "<room-root-id>", "wss://main.community.relay", "<room-root-pubkey>"],
    ["K", "11"]
  ],
  "content": "GM"
}
```

Room message replies follow NIP-C7 by adding a `q` tag for the parent chat message:

```json
{
  "kind": 9,
  "tags": [
    ["h", "<community-pubkey>"],
    ["E", "<room-root-id>", "wss://main.community.relay", "<room-root-pubkey>"],
    ["K", "11"],
    ["q", "<parent-message-id>", "wss://main.community.relay", "<parent-message-pubkey>"]
  ],
  "content": "nostr:nevent1...\nyes"
}
```

Room message query for one room:

```json
{
  "kinds": [9],
  "#h": ["<community-pubkey>"],
  "#E": ["<room-root-id>"]
}
```

Budabit should never query room messages by `#h = roomId`. `h` is reserved for the community pubkey in exclusive content.

## Room Archive Labels

Room archiving is represented by an admin label event.

Example:

```json
{
  "kind": 1985,
  "tags": [
    ["h", "<community-pubkey>"],
    ["E", "<room-root-id>", "wss://main.community.relay", "<room-root-pubkey>"],
    ["K", "11"],
    ["L", "budabit:room"],
    ["l", "archived", "budabit:room"]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```

Only labels authored by pubkeys with the relevant admin/write permission should be authoritative for Budabit's room archive state.

To unarchive, Budabit can publish a newer authoritative label that removes or supersedes the archived state, or use a paired label value such as `active`. The exact conflict-resolution rule should be timestamp-based and scoped to trusted admin authors.

## Publishing Relay Policy

| Event type                      | Publish relays                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Exclusive community events      | All `r` relays from latest `kind:10222`.                                                |
| Original targetable publication | User write relays plus community relays.                                                |
| `kind:30222` targeting event    | Community relays.                                                                       |
| Badge/profile-list admin events | Relays referenced by the community definition plus relevant issuer/list-manager relays. |
| User-private app data           | User relays only.                                                                       |

This keeps community discovery reliable without making original publications permanently dependent on one community's relay set.

## Fetching Workflow

Community bootstrap:

```json
{
  "kinds": [10222],
  "authors": ["<community-pubkey>"],
  "limit": 1
}
```

Exclusive room roots:

```json
{
  "kinds": [11],
  "#h": ["<community-pubkey>"],
  "#room": [""]
}
```

Some relays may not handle empty-value tag queries consistently. Budabit can fetch `kind:11` by `#h` and filter for the presence of `room` client-side.

Exclusive forum threads:

```json
{
  "kinds": [11],
  "#h": ["<community-pubkey>"]
}
```

Budabit must filter out `kind:11` events that contain a `room` tag.

Targeting events for community publications:

```json
{
  "kinds": [30222],
  "#p": ["<community-pubkey>"]
}
```

After loading and admitting `kind:30222`, Budabit fetches an explicit original via its `e` or `a` tag, or an implicit original via the wrapper's `d` targeting ID.

These are transport filters, not authorization filters. Exclusive community content is discovered by stable `#h = communityPubkey` plus feature structure such as kind, root IDs, or date tags. Targeting wrappers are discovered by stable `#p = communityPubkey` and `#k`. Budabit applies current-grant author admission locally to relay events, repository events, cache projections, and live updates instead of putting an ACL-sized `authors` array on the wire.

An `authors` field remains on exact authority, identity, or coordinate queries: community definitions; profile-list shards; grant-capable forms; personal profile and list metadata; `kind:pubkey:d` references; implicit originals tied to the wrapper signer; and same-author delete requests. These are singleton or semantically exact authors, not section ACL arrays.

Historical acquisition uses bounded raw-event cursor scans independently for each relay and structural filter. Budabit counts raw relay events before local admission. A full page is saturated because Nostr's inclusive `until` cursor cannot prove that more events do not share the oldest timestamp; page-budget exhaustion, timeout, disconnect, or `CLOSED` likewise makes the scan incomplete. Partial admitted rows may render with an incomplete warning, but zero admitted rows from an incomplete scan must not render as authoritative emptiness.

## Notifications And Shared Consumers

Active-community notification candidates, global notification rows, route projections, activity/reaction consumers, and extension queries use the same current-grant admission as their destination views. Broad `#h` or `#p` notification acquisition may run before profile-list hydration, but no permission-governed row is emitted without complete referenced profile-list and report-state evidence. Targeted notification roots use the same explicit-external and implicit-same-wrapper rules as routes, and community engagement rows require their referenced community root to pass admission too.

Foreground and background consumers coordinate live ownership by community and relay; repository watchers do the same by repository address and relay. When a foreground session already owns matching live coverage, the background notification consumer suppresses only its duplicate live subscription. Bounded finite catch-up may still run, and another community or repository on the same relay keeps its own live filters. Every consumer revalidates repository and live events when grant evidence changes so revocation removes rows and regrant can refetch them.

## Admin Key Model

Budabit should not require the community root key to be hot.

| Key                | Role                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Community root key | Signs `kind:0` and `kind:10222`. Should be cold or rarely used.                                                                             |
| Moderator key      | Updates delegated profile lists, reviews applications, creates community endorsements, and publishes admin labels. Can be hot or delegated. |
| User key           | Publishes user content when included in the relevant profile list.                                                                          |

The profile list `a` tags may reference lists managed by delegated pubkeys. Badge definitions and awards are discovered by badge-specific views and should not be required for community bootstrap or section access checks.

This allows Budabit to support practical admin workflows without exposing the main community key in a browser or server process.

## Admission Workflow

Budabit can support simple admission before implementing richer forms.

Minimum useful flow:

1. User requests access to a section or community role.
2. Admin reviews the request.
3. Admin adds the user's pubkey to the relevant `kind:30000` profile list.
4. Budabit treats the user as writable for that section.
5. Admin may award a community badge as separate recognition or onboarding context.

Future form-based flow:

1. A section application form is published as a NIP-101 form template.
2. User submits a `kind:1069` form response.
3. Admin or bot processes the response.
4. Admin or bot updates the profile list and may award a badge as recognition.

Access revocation remains list removal. Badge revocation, if standardized later, affects badge display unless Budabit explicitly adopts it as an additional permission signal.

## Routing Direction

The route model should move away from relay-encoded spaces.

Target direction:

| Current concept     | Target concept                                                    |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/spaces/[relay]`   | Community route keyed by pubkey or ncommunity-derived identifier. |
| Relay URL in route  | Community pubkey in route/session.                                |
| Room path `[h]`     | Room path by room root event ID.                                  |
| Platform relays env | Optional default community npub or bootstrap hints.               |

The deployed website may default to the Budabit community npub, but the app architecture must not derive community identity from deployment relays.

## Clean Break Scope

The target architecture removes these assumptions:

| Removed assumption                    | Replacement                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Relay URL is the community.           | Pubkey is the community.                                |
| `h` identifies a room.                | `h` identifies the community for exclusive events.      |
| `39000` room metadata drives rooms.   | `kind:11` immutable room roots drive rooms.             |
| Platform relays define the app space. | `kind:10222` defines community infrastructure.          |
| Relay auth is the main access model.  | Profile-list write permission is the client-side model. |
| Global roomless space chat exists.    | Every chat message belongs to a room.                   |

## Implementation Guardrails

This document describes the implemented community model, not the implementation phase plan.

Important guardrails:

1. Do not introduce relay URL based compatibility shims into the new core model.
2. Keep community admission distinct from privacy; current grants control Budabit visibility but do not make relay events confidential.
3. Keep `h = communityPubkey` reserved for exclusive community-native events.
4. Keep `h = targeting identifier` reserved for targetable publications that have a `kind:30222` association.
5. Treat the union of current section profile-list shards as the effective grant source for publishing and Budabit visibility.
6. Treat room root event IDs as canonical room IDs.
7. Keep one active community in the first UI, but model targeted publications as multi-community capable.
