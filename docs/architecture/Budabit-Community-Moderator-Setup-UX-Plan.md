# Budabit Community Moderator Setup UX Plan

> **Historical implementation plan.** This plan records work against the former Communikeys V1 workflow. Its `kind:10222` address shapes are not V2 guidance. Current authority-sensitive workflows use stable `h=<communityId>` plus a marked exact `a=<32222:controller:communityId>` branch reference; see `Communikeys.md`.

This plan replaces the current protocol-shaped moderation form editor with a moderator-facing setup flow for accepting and reviewing section applications.

The first priority is setup UX: a moderator should quickly understand whether users can apply, create or edit one active form per grantable section, preview the applicant experience, and publish without knowing Nostr form internals.

## Goals

- Make `/c/[community]/moderation` review-first by default.
- Surface setup health before the review queue.
- Highlight grantable sections that do not have an application form.
- Provide an `Edit forms` setup flow for section application forms.
- Never ask moderators to type or understand a `d` tag.
- Never ask moderators to construct raw field syntax.
- Let any eligible moderator edit the latest active form for a section by copying its values and publishing a newer valid form.
- Support multi-question application forms with preview before publishing.

## Non-Goals

- Redesign applicant-side submission UX in this pass.
- Add encrypted or anonymous applications.
- Add advanced NIP-101 field types beyond the first setup set.
- Add custom free-text handling for `Other` options in this pass.
- Add DM/NIP-44 notifications.

## Default Moderation Page

The moderation page opens in queue mode.

At the top, show an application setup card:

- If all grantable sections have forms, show a neutral/success state: `All grantable sections are accepting applications.`
- If one or more grantable sections are missing forms, show a warning state: `Users cannot apply to: General, Repo curator.`
- Put the `Edit forms` button inside this setup card.
- The warning should visually surround the setup CTA so the moderator understands the fix is to edit forms.

Below the setup card, show the review queue:

- New applications first.
- Granted and rejected applications after new applications.
- If setup is incomplete and the queue is empty, explain that missing forms prevent users from applying.
- If setup is complete and the queue is empty, say there are no applications yet.

## Edit Forms Flow

Clicking `Edit forms` switches the page to form setup mode.

Setup mode has two primary regions:

- Section list.
- Form builder and preview for the selected section.

### Section List

List every section the current signer can grant.

Each section item shows:

- Section name.
- Setup status: `Ready`, `Missing form`, or `Draft changes`.
- Active form name when a form exists.
- A clear selected state.

Missing-form sections use warning styling. The selected section must be obvious on the list item, not only inferred from the editor.

### Active Form Rule

Budabit has one active application form per content section.

The active form is the latest valid `kind:30168` form from an eligible moderator for that section, using the deterministic latest-form ordering already defined by community admission helpers.

When a moderator edits a section:

- If a latest active form exists, load its name, description, and questions into the draft.
- If no form exists, create a draft with generated defaults.
- Publishing always emits a new valid `kind:30168` form authored by the current signer.
- The newly published form becomes the active form for all moderators and users when it wins latest-form selection.

### Identifier Rule

The moderator never sees or edits the `d` tag.

Identifier behavior:

- If the current moderator already has a form for that section, preserve that moderator-owned identifier so publishing replaces their addressable form.
- If the latest active form was authored by another moderator, copy its content but publish with the current moderator's generated identifier.
- If no current-moderator form exists, generate a stable identifier from community and section, for example `community-<community-prefix>-<section-slug>-application`.

## Form Builder

Each selected section gets a structured draft.

Draft fields:

- `sectionName`
- `identifier`
- `name`
- `description`
- `questions`
- `dirty`

Default values:

- Name: `<sectionName> application`
- Description: `Request access to publish in the <sectionName> section.`
- First question: `Describe your application to publish in <sectionName>`

Generated defaults count as valid. Moderators can publish without changing them.

### Question Cards

Question cards are inspired by `nostr-forms` but fit Budabit's Svelte UI.

Each card supports:

- Editable question text.
- Question type selector.
- Required toggle.
- Delete button.
- Move up/down buttons.
- Disabled answer preview.

Supported question types for this pass:

- Short answer: one-line disabled input preview.
- Paragraph: disabled textarea preview.
- Single choice: radio options, `Add option`, and `add other`.
- Multiple choice: checkbox options, `Add option`, and `add other`.

`add other` simply adds an `Other` option for now. Applicant-side custom free-text handling is deferred to the applicant UX pass.

## Preview Before Publish

The form setup flow includes a preview mode before publish.

On desktop, preview may appear beside the builder. On mobile, use `Build` and `Preview` toggles.

Preview shows:

- Form name.
- Form description.
- Selected section.
- All questions in order.
- Disabled applicant-style answer controls.

Publishing is disabled until validation passes:

- Name is present.
- Description is present.
- At least one question exists.
- Every question has text.
- Single-choice and multiple-choice questions have at least two non-empty options.

## NIP-101 Encoding

The builder converts structured drafts into existing Budabit admission form templates.

Mapping:

- Short answer -> `field` type `text`, settings `{renderElement: "shortText", required: true}`.
- Paragraph -> `field` type `text`, settings `{renderElement: "paragraph", required: true}`.
- Single choice -> `field` type `option`, settings `{renderElement: "singleChoice", required: true}`.
- Multiple choice -> `field` type `option`, settings `{renderElement: "multipleChoice", required: true}`.

Choice options remain normal NIP-101 option values. `Other` is encoded as a normal option with settings `{isOther: true}`.

Required template tags remain:

- `d`
- `a = 10222:<community-pubkey>:`
- `content = <sectionName>`
- `name`
- `settings` with description
- `relay` tags
- `field` tags

Forms publish only to active community relays.

## Section Lifecycle Changes

Community admins can rename sections, move publish types between sections, or remove sections from the community setup form. These edits affect moderator setup because active forms and moderator permission requests are tied to the section identity used when they were published.

Expected UX:

- Show an immediate warning after a dangerous draft edit, before publish.
- Make the main warning action reset only that edit: `Reset rename`, `Reset move`, or `Reset removal`.
- Let the admin keep the draft change and continue editing.
- Keep a persistent summary panel near publish with changed sections, members to migrate, moderators who must accept again, forms to copy, and pending requests that will be dropped.
- Add `Reset changes` in edit mode to restore the originally loaded community metadata and definition, not Budabit defaults.

Migration behavior:

- Active granted members are merged into a new admin-owned permission list for the destination section.
- Active moderators receive new destination-section permission requests and must accept them before they can grant access there.
- Active forms are copied as admin-authored forms for destination sections that do not already have an active form.
- Pending applications are not migrated and should be clearly warned about.
- Applicant-authored submissions are not copied or faked.
- User-authored reports are not copied or faked.

The final publish modal is the only place where migration happens. Migration updates publish and verify before the updated community definition is published.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Draft Model And Helpers

- Add structured draft types and helpers near community form helpers.
- Generate stable identifiers.
- Convert active forms into editable drafts.
- Convert drafts into `CommunityFormFieldInput[]`.
- Validate drafts.
- Add focused tests.

### Phase 2: Moderation Page Layout

- Add queue/setup mode state.
- Add setup status card above queue.
- Add missing-form warning summary.
- Keep review queue as the default view.
- Improve empty states based on setup health.

### Phase 3: Section Form Setup UI

- Add grantable section list with selected and missing states.
- Load latest active section form into a draft.
- Generate default drafts when missing.
- Publish drafts as moderator-authored forms.

### Phase 4: Question Builder And Preview

- Replace raw textarea field construction.
- Add structured question cards.
- Add type selector and option editors.
- Add build/preview toggle.
- Disable publish until validation passes.

### Phase 5: Verification

- Run focused community form tests.
- Run `npm run check`.
- Run `npm run test:main`.
- Run `npm run build`.

## Success Criteria

- A moderator can see immediately which grantable sections are not accepting applications.
- A moderator can create a valid application form without knowing NIP-101 syntax.
- A moderator can edit the latest active form for a section, even if another eligible moderator authored it.
- The selected section and missing-form states are obvious.
- A moderator can build multiple questions and preview the form before publishing.
- Published forms remain compatible with the existing applicant and review lifecycle.
