# Budabit Community Moderation

This document describes how moderation, admission, and section access should work in Budabit communities.

The goal is to let communities stay readable and discoverable while keeping publication rights high-signal, fine-grained, and delegated to moderators instead of requiring the branch owner key for day-to-day work.

## Summary

Budabit community branches use addressable `kind:32222` Communikey definitions for stable community structure and definition-native metadata. Current section grants from `kind:30000` profile lists govern publishing and permission-governed Budabit visibility. Admission requests use NIP-101 forms created by moderators, not by the branch owner.

Moderators create application forms as `kind:30168` events. A form references the community definition with an `a` tag and identifies the requested section with a `content` tag. Users submit public, identified `kind:1069` responses to request access. Moderators review responses and either grant access by updating the section profile list and publishing a positive review, or reject by reacting negatively to the response.

## Core Decisions

| Topic                    | Decision                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Community root stability | `kind:32222` should change rarely and must not list application forms.                                                                                               |
| Form ownership           | Application forms are authored by moderators with grant capability for the section.                                                                                  |
| Form discovery           | Forms are discovered from community relays by community `a` tag and section `content` tag.                                                                           |
| Community visibility     | Relays may serve public candidates, but Budabit admits permission-governed content under current section grants.                                                     |
| Write access             | Effective publish permission comes from section profile-list membership.                                                                                             |
| Admission request        | Users submit an identified public `kind:1069` response to the selected application form.                                                                             |
| Duplicate applications   | Budabit allows one active submission per user/form. Resubmission requires a `kind:5` delete of the old response.                                                     |
| Grant                    | Update the section profile list and publish a `+` reaction on the response.                                                                                          |
| Reject                   | Publish a `-` reaction on the response. No profile-list edit.                                                                                                        |
| Root visibility          | Root-level section content only appears when explicitly allowed by current section permissions and targeting rules. Replies do not make roots visible.               |
| Censoring                | Explicit moderation uses NIP-56 `kind:1984` reports with report type `spam`; it is a negative overlay on top of normal visibility and write permissions.             |
| Relays                   | Forms, responses, and profile-list edits use community/authority relays. Review reactions also reach applicant/app discovery relays and carry community relay hints. |
| Anonymous submissions    | Not supported. Admission requests must be tied to the requesting pubkey.                                                                                             |

## Why Forms Are Not In `kind:32222`

Application forms are operational moderation state. They may change frequently as moderators improve questions, requirements, onboarding language, and anti-spam checks.

`kind:32222` is exact branch configuration. It should be stable, rare to update, and usually signed by a cold or high-trust owner key. Requiring the owner to update application forms would make admission workflows too rigid and would prevent delegated moderators from curating section-specific applications.

Instead, forms self-associate with the community and section:

```json
{
  "kind": 30168,
  "pubkey": "<moderator-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "code-curator-application"],
    ["h", "<community-id>"],
    ["a", "32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>", "wss://community.example", "community"],
    ["content", "Code-curator"],
    ["name", "Code curator application"],
    ["settings", "{\"description\":\"Tell us why you should curate repositories.\"}"],
    [
      "field",
      "experience",
      "text",
      "What relevant experience do you have?",
      "",
      "{\"required\":true}"
    ],
    [
      "field",
      "focus",
      "text",
      "What kinds of repositories will you add?",
      "",
      "{\"required\":true}"
    ]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```

The form's stable association is `h=<communityId>`. Its adjacent `a` tag has marker `community` and names the exact definition address whose current grants authorize the workflow.

## Moderator Authority

A moderator can create and review forms for a section only when the moderator can grant that section's access.

Admission review reactions are published to the scoped community relays and to normalized applicant/app discovery relays. They carry the community relay set as `relay` tags so an applicant who is denied or finally revoked can discover the addressed review first. The client bounds those untrusted hints and uses them only to bootstrap the exact signed definition, refreshes that definition on its own declared relays, and then partitions form, response, review-history, profile-list, report, and delete queries by community relay scope. Explicit profile-list relay coordinates are prioritized within the bounded authority set.

Grant capability requires profile-list management:

| Capability              | Source                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Profile-list management | The moderator pubkey owns the referenced coordinate and has published its current non-declined `kind:30000` event. |

This keeps the access-control model simple and prevents users from applying through forms whose authors cannot approve them.

Badges are community endorsements and engagement primitives. They do not grant write access and do not make a pubkey a moderator.

If a future community wants separate reviewers who cannot grant access, Budabit can add a reviewer role later. That should be explicit rather than inferred from form authorship.

### Profile-list shards

A section may repeat `a` tags to reference several distinct profile-list coordinates. The effective section grant set is the union of the current `p` tags in all loaded shards. Sharding keeps large grant sets within relay event-size and tag-count limits; it does not weaken coordinate authority, so every shard is fetched with its exact author and `d` identifier. An unresolved shard contributes no grants.

## Section Forms

Form discovery starts from the active community definition.

For a requested section:

1. Find the section in the accepted current definition at the exact `kind:32222` address.
2. Derive grant-capable moderator pubkeys from references whose current list events exist and are not declined.
3. Query community relays for `kind:30168` authored by those moderators and tagged to the community definition.
4. Client-side filter to forms with `content = <section name>`.
5. Resolve the active form by addressable event semantics and deterministic ordering.

Example form query:

```json
{
  "kinds": [30168],
  "authors": ["<moderator-pubkey-1>", "<moderator-pubkey-2>"],
  "#a": ["32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>"]
}
```

Budabit should filter `content` tags client-side because section names are application semantics and relay support for arbitrary tag filters may vary.

When multiple eligible forms are found for the same section, Budabit should select one active form with this ordering:

| Step | Rule                                                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Collapse replaceable/addressable form updates by `30168:<author>:<d>`. |
| 2    | Keep the newest event per form address.                                |
| 3    | Across eligible form addresses, choose highest `created_at`.           |
| 4    | If timestamps tie, choose the lowest event id.                         |

This lets moderators supersede forms without touching `kind:32222`.

## Application Responses

Applications are public NIP-101 responses authored by the applicant.

```json
{
  "kind": 1069,
  "pubkey": "<applicant-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30168:<form-pubkey>:code-curator-application", "", "form"],
    ["h", "<community-id>"],
    ["a", "32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>", "", "community"],
    ["response", "experience", "I maintain several Nostr repositories.", "{}"],
    ["response", "focus", "Developer tooling and protocol libraries.", "{}"]
  ],
  "content": ""
}
```

Budabit should not support anonymous admission applications because the request must map to the pubkey being granted access.

Only community relays should be used for application publication and review state. A user may read public community content without membership, but admission state belongs to the community's relay set.

## Submission Lifecycle

Budabit allows one active submission per user and application form.

| State    | Meaning                                                                       | User action                                                                    |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| None     | No non-deleted response exists.                                               | Fill and submit the form.                                                      |
| Pending  | A response exists and has no authorized `+` or `-` review reaction.           | View submission or delete to resubmit.                                         |
| Granted  | An authorized `+` reaction exists or the user is in the section profile list. | Access is available.                                                           |
| Rejected | An authorized `-` reaction exists and no newer authorized grant exists.       | Delete the submission to submit a revised application.                         |
| Deleted  | A valid `kind:5` by the applicant deletes the response.                       | The previous answers may be locally preserved for editing before resubmission. |

If a relay accepts multiple active submissions from outside Budabit, Budabit should surface the latest non-deleted response by timestamp and then lowest id. The UI may warn that multiple active submissions exist, but normal application logic should use the selected current response.

Delete event example:

```json
{
  "kind": 5,
  "pubkey": "<applicant-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<form-response-event-id>", "", "<applicant-pubkey>", "response"],
    ["k", "1069"],
    ["h", "<community-id>"],
    ["a", "32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>", "", "community"]
  ],
  "content": "Deleted application submission"
}
```

A delete only counts when it is authored by the same pubkey as the response being deleted.

Deleting a response removes it from active submission selection. It does not erase moderator decisions from review history. Budabit should still surface prior authorized reviews for the applicant when they submit again, because a new pending response should not appear as if no prior rejection or revocation exists.

## Review Events

Granting access publishes two events:

```json
[
  {
    "kind": 30000,
    "pubkey": "<profile-list-manager-pubkey>",
    "tags": [
      ["d", "<community-id>-code-curator"],
      ["p", "<existing-writer-pubkey>"],
      ["p", "<applicant-pubkey>"]
    ],
    "content": ""
  },
  {
    "kind": 7,
    "pubkey": "<moderator-pubkey>",
    "tags": [
      ["e", "<form-response-event-id>", "", "<applicant-pubkey>", "response"],
      ["p", "<applicant-pubkey>"],
      ["k", "1069"],
      ["a", "30168:<form-author-pubkey>:code-curator-application", "", "form"],
      ["h", "<community-id>"],
      ["a", "32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>", "", "community"],
      ["content", "Code-curator"]
    ],
    "content": "+"
  }
]
```

Rejecting access publishes only a negative reaction:

```json
{
  "kind": 7,
  "pubkey": "<moderator-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<form-response-event-id>", "", "<applicant-pubkey>", "response"],
    ["p", "<applicant-pubkey>"],
    ["k", "1069"],
    ["a", "30168:<form-author-pubkey>:code-curator-application", "", "form"],
    ["h", "<community-id>"],
    ["a", "32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>", "", "community"],
    ["content", "Code-curator"]
  ],
  "content": "-"
}
```

Only reactions authored by grant-capable moderators for the requested section should count as review decisions.

The `+` reaction is intentionally redundant with the profile-list edit. It creates a review audit marker, makes moderation queues easy to group, and preserves evidence of grants even if a profile list is accidentally overwritten.

Review history is discovered separately from active responses. For applicants or visible queue entries, Budabit should query enriched review reactions by applicant, community, and response kind:

```json
{
  "kinds": [7],
  "#p": ["<applicant-pubkey>"],
  "#h": ["<community-id>"],
  "#k": ["1069"]
}
```

The client then filters by section `content` tag and, when needed, form `a` tag. This lets the active submission remain `pending` after resubmission while the UI still displays context such as `Previously rejected`.

## Effective Permissions

Budabit should present access in human section terms, but enforce it by publish effect.

A section defines the event kinds and optional Budabit subtypes it authorizes. From this, Budabit derives a capability map for the logged-in user.

Example:

| Section      | Section grants                                                                       | User result                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General      | `kind:9` room messages, `kind:1111` comments, `kind:7` reactions, `kind:1985` labels | User may chat, comment, react, and label where those actions are valid. |
| Code curator | `kind:30617` repo announcements and `kind:1623` permalinks                           | User may publish directly bound repos and targeted permalinks.          |

A user with General access but not Code curator access may react to a repository event but may not publish a new repository announcement or permalink for the community.

This avoids coupling UI features directly to section names. UI components should declare what they publish, and the permission layer maps that publish effect to the relevant section and application flow.

### Exact section mapping

Permission resolution maps each exact `(kind, subtype)` pair to one section in the active community definition. Empty subtype is an exact value. It does not mean every subtype for that kind.

Community setup should prevent duplicate exact pairs because duplicate pairs make access requests, form discovery, and publish gates ambiguous. If an external malformed definition contains duplicates, Budabit should resolve a publish target to one section only and avoid treating one grant as a wildcard for another subtype.

### Section rename, move, and removal

Renaming a section, moving a `(kind, subtype)` pair to another section, or removing a section changes permission identity. The edit may invalidate existing profile-list references, moderator form ownership, and pending applications.

Budabit's admin form therefore uses two safety layers:

- Immediate warning modals appear after a dangerous draft edit and offer `Reset rename`, `Reset move`, or `Reset removal` as the primary action.
- The final publish modal summarizes the pending permission changes and offers publishing with or without migration.

When migration is selected:

- Granted members from old active lists are merged into a new admin-owned list for the destination section.
- Active moderators get new destination-section permission requests and must accept them before they can grant again.
- Active forms are copied as admin-authored forms for destination sections that need a form.
- Reviewed report decisions can be recreated by the admin for the destination section when Budabit can identify the original decision.
- Migration updates are published and verified on community relays before the updated community definition is published.

Pending application requests are not migrated. Applicant submissions are not copied. User-authored event reports remain historical relay evidence and are not recreated by the admin.

## Code Curator

The Code curator community section controls who may publish repository announcements and permalinks into the community. It does not replace repository-level authority. Once a repository exists, issue and pull request moderation uses the repository owner and declared maintainers from the NIP-34 repo announcement.

Repository authority is intentionally narrower than community write access. A user with Code curator section access may publish repo announcements and permalinks, but they do not automatically become a maintainer of every repository in that section.

Definitions:

| Role                | Source                                                                       |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repo owner          | The pubkey that authored the repository announcement.                        |
| Declared maintainer | Pubkeys listed in the repo announcement `maintainers` tag.                   |
| Verified maintainer | A declared maintainer with at least one owner-merged PR in the current repo. |
| Issue author        | The pubkey that authored the issue root event.                               |
| PR author           | The pubkey that authored the pull request root event.                        |

Status resolution is shared in `@nostr-git/core`. Budabit should pass the same repository owner and maintainer set to both the status resolver and the status editor UI. This keeps the displayed final state and the visible “Change Status” affordance aligned.

Verified maintainer is a repo-scoped UI signal, not a new permission class. It is derived from the current repo announcement plus PR/status evidence: the user is currently declared in the `maintainers` tag, authored a PR for this repo, and the repo owner authored the applied/merged status event for that PR. Removing the user from the current maintainer tag removes the signal.

### Issue Permissions

| Action                  |                  Issue Author | Repo Owner | Declared Maintainer |        Other User |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------: | ---------: | ------------------: | ----------------: |
| Change issue status     | Yes, unless imported/mirrored |        Yes |                 Yes |                No |
| Edit issue title        |                           Yes |        Yes |                 Yes |                No |
| Edit issue description  |                           Yes |        Yes |                 Yes |                No |
| Add/remove issue labels |                           Yes |        Yes |                 Yes |                No |
| Add/remove assignees    |                           Yes |        Yes |                 Yes |                No |
| Comment/react           |                           Yes |        Yes |                 Yes | Yes, if signed in |
| Hide issue as spam      |                            No |        Yes |                  No |                No |

Reasoning: issue authors should be able to manage their own issue metadata and status, but repository owners and maintainers need authority to triage issues they do not own. Spam hiding is owner-only because it is a global repository visibility override rather than a normal collaborative edit.

### Pull Request Permissions

| Action                  |                        PR Author | Repo Owner | Declared Maintainer |        Other User |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------: | ---------: | ------------------: | ----------------: |
| Change PR status        |    Yes, unless imported/mirrored |        Yes |                 Yes |                No |
| Edit PR description     |                              Yes |        Yes |                 Yes |                No |
| Merge/manage PR actions | No, unless also maintainer/owner |        Yes |                 Yes |                No |
| Comment/react           |                              Yes |        Yes |                 Yes | Yes, if signed in |
| Hide PR as spam         |                               No |        Yes |                  No |                No |

Reasoning: PR authors can update their own proposal text and status, but merge and repository-management actions belong to the repository owner and maintainers. This lets maintainers close, draft, reopen, or merge PRs without needing ownership of the original PR event.

### Imported Or Mirrored Roots

| Role                           |        Status Authority |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------: |
| Synthetic/imported root author |                      No |
| Imported baseline status event | Can be used as baseline |
| Repo owner                     |                     Yes |
| Declared maintainer            |                     Yes |

Reasoning: imported issues and PRs may have synthetic authors or imported baseline status events that preserve state from another platform. Those imported roots should not grant ongoing authority to the synthetic root author. Repository owners and declared maintainers remain able to update status after import.

## Permission-Gated UX

Budabit should not hide inaccessible capabilities. It should show them as available community affordances that require access.

Every publishing component should be wrapped by a generic publish gate that receives the event kind, subtype if any, and a user-facing action label.

| Gate state         | UI behavior                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allowed            | Render the normal action.                                                                    |
| Logged out         | Render the action as muted and ask the user to log in before applying or publishing.         |
| Missing permission | Render the action as muted, explain the required section permission, and link to Membership. |
| Pending            | Show that an application is pending and link to the submission.                              |
| Rejected           | Show rejected state and link to delete/resubmit flow.                                        |
| Recently granted   | Render normally and optionally highlight that access was granted.                            |

Examples:

| UI element          | Missing-access behavior                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Chat composer       | Replace input with a compact request-access component for room-message permission.               |
| Publish repo button | Keep visible but disabled with tooltip and link to repository access request.                    |
| Reaction button     | Keep visible; if reaction permission is missing, open the Membership page instead of publishing. |
| Create room button  | Keep visible in muted state and explain that Rooms permission is required.                       |

The user should always understand what permission is missing and where to request it.

## Read Visibility Policy

Budabit separates positive visibility from negative moderation.

Positive visibility answers whether content is community-approved by default. Negative moderation answers whether otherwise visible content should be hidden because an authorized moderator or admin explicitly censored it.

### Root-Level Events

Root-level events MUST only appear when they are explicitly allowed by the current community state.

Examples of root-level events include:

| Feature                  | Root event                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rooms                    | Room root `kind:11`/thread event with the Budabit room marker.                                         |
| Threads                  | Thread root `kind:11` without the room marker.                                                         |
| Calendar-event-creator   | `kind:31922` event explicitly targeted to the community.                                               |
| Fundraiser-goals-creator | `kind:9041` event explicitly targeted to the community.                                                |
| Code-curator             | `kind:30617` repository announcements directly bound by one `h=<communityId>`, and `kind:1623` permalinks explicitly targeted to the community. |
| Widget-curator           | `kind:30033` event explicitly targeted to the community.                                               |

Rules:

- A root event is visible only if it passes the section's current author allow-list and targeting rules.
- A valid reply, chat message, quote, mention, or other reference MUST NOT make an otherwise disallowed root event appear as a community root.
- If a root author's section access is revoked, their root events disappear from default section views and direct community detail pages unless separately allowed again later.
- If access is regranted, Budabit restarts structural acquisition so matching historical roots can be refetched and reappear.
- Budabit does not currently implement historical “was allowed when posted” visibility. Current community state is the source of truth.

### Reply-Like Events

Reply-like events are visible when their conversation root is visible and the reply-like event itself passes the relevant section permission rules.

Examples:

| Feature                                  | Reply-like event                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rooms                                    | Room message `kind:9`.                                           |
| Threads and targetable event discussions | Comment `kind:1111`.                                             |
| Reactions and labels                     | `kind:7` and `kind:1985` where the current feature renders them. |

Rules:

- A permitted reply-like event may quote, mention, or reference any other event without additional warning labels.
- References do not grant root visibility to the referenced event.
- Explicit censoring still applies. If the referenced event or referenced event author is censored for the current context, render a moderation placeholder instead of the content.

This keeps normal conversations readable while avoiding root-level content smuggling.

## NIP-56 Censor Overlay

Budabit uses NIP-56 `kind:1984` reports as explicit moderation events. For community censoring, Budabit uses report type `spam` because it maps to unwanted content in a community context without inventing a new report type.

The censor overlay has precedence over default read visibility and write permission. It only hides content that would otherwise be considered for rendering.

### Report Shapes

Event censoring:

```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "pubkey": "<moderator-or-admin-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<event-id>", "spam"],
    ["p", "<event-author-pubkey>"],
    ["h", "<community-id>"],
    ["a", "32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>", "", "community"],
    ["content", "<section-name>"]
  ],
  "content": "Optional moderation note"
}
```

Addressable event censoring:

```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "pubkey": "<moderator-or-admin-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["e", "<specific-event-version-id>", "spam"],
    ["a", "<target-kind>:<event-author-pubkey>:<d-tag>", "spam"],
    ["p", "<event-author-pubkey>"],
    ["h", "<community-id>"],
    ["a", "32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>", "", "community"],
    ["content", "<section-name>"]
  ],
  "content": "Optional moderation note"
}
```

For addressable events, Budabit treats the reason-bearing target `a` tag as stronger than the `e` tag: the report censors the address, not only the specific event version. Later replacements at the same `kind:pubkey:d` remain censored until the report is revoked. The community scope `a` tag has marker `community` and names the exact `32222:<owner>:<communityId>` definition; it is not a report target.

Person censoring:

```json
{
  "kind": 1984,
  "pubkey": "<admin-or-all-section-moderator-pubkey>",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<reported-pubkey>", "spam"],
    ["h", "<community-id>"],
    ["a", "32222:<owner-pubkey>:<community-id>", "", "community"]
  ],
  "content": "Optional moderation note"
}
```

Rules:

- Event moderation is section-scoped and may be performed by an admin or a current moderator with grant capability for that section.
- A reason-bearing target `a` tag on a parameterized replaceable event applies to every replacement at that address.
- The marked community definition `a` tag is branch authority metadata only; it must not be interpreted as the moderated target.
- Person moderation is community-scoped and may be performed by an admin or a current moderator who has grant capability for every section in the latest community definition.
- Admin means the owner of the selected exact definition branch.
- Moderators cannot moderate another current moderator.
- Admin reports supersede moderator protection.
- Reports by removed moderators stop counting at render time.
- A report can be deleted with `kind:5`; deleted reports MUST be ignored.
- Censoring displays a placeholder such as `Moderated event` or `Moderated person` instead of silently dropping the item in contexts where a placeholder preserves conversation shape.

The render-time authority check is mandatory. Budabit must not trust that reports were only published through the web app.

### Censoring And Quotes

Quote and reference rendering is community-aware through the negative path:

- If a quoted event is not censored and can be fetched, it may render normally inside a permitted reply-like event.
- If a quoted event is censored by event id in the current section context, render `Moderated event`.
- If a quoted event author is censored community-wide, render `Moderated person`.
- If the quoted event cannot be fetched, render the existing unloaded quote state.

This avoids overcomplicating positive reference permissions while still preventing explicitly unwanted content from being smuggled through quotes.

### Censoring Scope

| Censor type | Scope     | Who can publish an effective report                        |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event       | Section   | Admin or grant-capable moderator for that section.         |
| Person      | Community | Admin or moderator with grant capability for all sections. |

Section-scoped person moderation is intentionally not supported. Person moderation is stronger than hiding one event and should require community-wide authority.

## Membership Page

Budabit should provide one community-level membership page for normal users.

Suggested route:

```text
/c/<community>/access
```

The page should show:

| Area      | Contents                                                   |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Granted   | Sections and publish effects the user can currently use.   |
| Pending   | Active submissions waiting for moderator review.           |
| Rejected  | Rejected submissions with delete/resubmit actions.         |
| Available | Sections with application forms that the user can request. |

Existing submissions are not editable. To change an application, the user must explicitly delete it, confirm the delete in a modal, and then submit a new response. Budabit may preserve the deleted response values locally to make editing easy.

## Moderator Panel

The moderator panel should be separate from the admin or owner panel. Owner/admin tools manage community root setup. Moderator tools manage forms, applications, grants, and rejections for sections the logged-in moderator can grant.

The moderation queue should be grouped by review state:

| Group    | Sort                               |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| New      | Newest pending submissions first.  |
| Granted  | Newest granted submissions first.  |
| Rejected | Newest rejected submissions first. |

Each application card should show:

| Field                  | Purpose                                  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Applicant profile      | Make the applicant recognizable.         |
| Requested section      | Show what permission is being requested. |
| Form name              | Show which admission form was answered.  |
| Submitted time         | Help moderators process recent requests. |
| Short response summary | Let moderators scan quickly.             |
| Review action          | Open or expand full response details.    |

The review view should show the full response and buttons to grant or reject. Grant should publish the profile-list edit and `+` reaction; it may also publish a badge award as recognition or onboarding context. Reject should publish the `-` reaction.

## Fetching Permissioned Views

For content subject to section permissions, Budabit loads the current community definition and exact referenced profile-list shards before admitting section content. Missing authority evidence fails closed: a broad relay result may be retained as a candidate, but it is not community-approved content and cannot establish an empty or populated view by itself.

Relay discovery uses stable structural tags rather than an ACL-sized `authors` array. For example, direct community content uses:

```json
{
  "kinds": [11],
  "#h": ["<community-id>"]
}
```

Targeted content starts with wrappers discovered by stable `#h=<communityId>` and `#k=<original-kind>`. Budabit requires the adjacent marked community `a` for the selected exact branch and admits a wrapper only when its author has the current grant for that kind. An explicit source `e` or `a` may identify an external-author original; an implicit original must use `h=<wrapper-targeting-id>` and be signed by the same author as the admitted wrapper. Community targeting through `p=<communityId>` is invalid.

Current grants are applied locally to historical pages, live updates, repository/cache projections, notifications, shared activity/reaction consumers, and extension results. Revocation therefore hides previously visible direct content and wrappers; regrant changes the admission evidence, restarts/refilters consumers, and permits history to be refetched and reappear. Relays are not assumed to perform this policy.

Exact `authors` filters remain where authorship is the requested authority or identity: exact `kind:32222` definitions, referenced profile-list shards, grant-capable forms, personal metadata and lists, exact `kind:pubkey:d` coordinates, implicit same-wrapper originals, and same-author deletion requests. These filters are not section writer arrays.

Broad historical requests use bounded raw-event cursor scans per relay and per structural filter. The cursor advances from raw relay events, not only admitted events, so outsider-only pages cannot create false emptiness or starve an older current writer. Page-budget exhaustion, timeout, disconnect, `CLOSED`, or a full page with possible same-timestamp overflow is incomplete, not empty. Notifications require complete grant and report evidence, may share foreground live coverage for the same community and relay, and keep bounded finite catch-up separate from local row admission.

## Rationale

This model accepts some application workflow overhead because it gives communities a competitive moderation surface.

Communities can set different requirements for different publishing capabilities. They can keep general participation easy while making higher-impact publication types more curated. Moderators can improve forms and review processes without using the branch owner key. Users can still browse the community and understand what capabilities they can unlock.

Good UX is essential. The process should feel like requesting a community capability, not filing paperwork. The app should keep inaccessible actions visible, explain the missing permission, and route the user to a single place where requests, grants, and rejections are understandable.
