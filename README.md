# Budabit

Budabit is a community-first Nostr client for social Git collaboration.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: This project requires Node.js LTS (Jod) as specified in `.nvmrc`
- **pnpm**: Version **10.12.4**, pinned in `package.json`
- **Git**: For cloning and contributing

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Node.js with nvm (Recommended)

If you don't have nvm installed, install it first:

```bash
# Install nvm (macOS/Linux)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Or on Windows
# Download and run the installer from: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
```

Then install and use the correct Node.js version:

```bash
# Install and use Node.js LTS (Jod)
nvm install lts/jod
nvm use lts/jod

# Verify Node.js version
node --version
```

### 2. Install pnpm

```bash
# Install the version pinned by this repository
npm install -g pnpm@10.12.4

# Verify installation
pnpm --version
```

### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the development branch, including all package sources
git clone --branch dev https://github.com/Pleb5/flotilla-budabit.git budabit
cd budabit
# Create a branch for your contribution
git switch -c my-feature
```

Budabit is a self-contained monorepo: **Releases, Pipelines, the extension
template/SDK, nostr-git core/UI, and Welshman** are ordinary tracked source under
`packages/`. A plain clone includes everything; no Git submodule initialization
is required. All packages use the root pnpm workspace and lockfile. See the
[workspace guide](docs/development/workspaces.md) for package commands and ownership.

Kanban is maintained in its [standalone repository](https://grasp.budabit.club/npub16p8v7varqwjes5hak6q7mz6pygqm4pwc6gve4mrned3xs8tz42gq7kfhdw/budabit-kanban-extension.git)
and is not part of Budabit's clone, workspace, or test setup.

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all workspaces (also builds core/UI and the local bridge/SDK exports)
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
# Start the app and rebuild local core/UI dependencies as they change
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:1847`. The dev server uses a strict port; stop the other process if port `1847` is already in use.

`pnpm dev` checks that port before rebuilding workspace packages. The UI package
generates its stylesheet in ignored `styles/index.css`, separately from Svelte's
`dist` output, and replaces it atomically after successful compilation. Its CSS
watcher uses the same build path for source and Tailwind configuration changes.

Use `pnpm dev:app` when working only on application code and the local package build outputs are already current.

## Features

Budabit combines Communikey communities with decentralized Git functionality through the Nostr Git protocol:

- **Communikey Communities**: Select an exact `kind:32222` community branch by its canonical definition `naddr`; definition tags provide metadata, relays, sections, permissions, and media servers
- **Decentralized Git Repositories**: Discover and manage Git repositories using Nostr relays and Git remotes
- **[New Repo onboarding](docs/features/new-repository-onboarding.md)**: Create a repository or import independent Git copies from a public GitHub, GitLab, Gitea or Forgejo/Codeberg source into writable destinations, then announce the new repository on Nostr
- **Issue And Pull Request Tracking**: Create, manage, and discuss issues and PRs with Nostr-native status updates
- **Community Catalogs**: Target repositories, calendar events, goals, permalinks, and widgets to `/c/<community>` pages
- **Extensions And Smart Widgets**: Install Smart Widget extensions from Nostr `kind:30033` events; built-in extensions are not bundled by default
- **[Community Marketplace](docs/features/freelance.md)**: One default section groups SatShoot-compatible jobs, services, proposals, orders, reviews, and NIP-99 classified listings; community-targeted Freelance and Classifieds widgets provide the workspaces
- **Collaborative Development**: Work with teams using Nostr-based communication, moderation, and membership requests
- **Notifications**: In-app badges and sounds plus an account-wide Git email digest from a provider endorsed by one of the user's communities

## Community architecture and policies

- [Access decisions and policy boundaries](docs/architecture/Community-Access-Decisions.md): deployment levels, hosting trade-offs, membership versus writing, eventual admission, privacy and deferred discovery.
- [Community architecture](docs/architecture/Budabit-Community-Architecture.md) and [Communikeys wire specification](docs/architecture/Communikeys.md).
- [Moderation](docs/architecture/Budabit-Community-Moderation.md), [relay publishing](docs/architecture/Budabit-Relay-Publishing-Policy.md), and [private read lifecycle/capabilities](docs/architecture/Community-Read-Control-Plan.md).
- [NIP-4444 project DM draft](docs/architecture/NIP-4444.md): NIP-44 encryption and inbox-relay routing.

Member-only relay admission is optional and implemented in source, not a claim of
a released or live private deployment. The public community workflows remain the
default; private mode does not yet have full public-feature parity.

Shared relays can host publicly readable communities with independent write control.
For member-only reads, prefer a dedicated, community-controlled relay instance/database;
multi-community read isolation within one database is deliberately deferred. See the
[hosting decision and trade-offs](docs/architecture/Community-Access-Decisions.md#hosting-boundary-shared-public-writes-dedicated-member-only-reads).

## Environment

Create an optional `.env` file in the repo root. Use `.env.example` as the reference.

App identity and branding:

- `VITE_APP_URL` - Public app URL used for app metadata and internal link detection
- `VITE_APP_NAME` - App name used for protocol metadata
- `VITE_APP_LOGO` - App logo URL and source image for generated PWA assets
- `VITE_APP_ACCENT` - Primary accent color
- `VITE_APP_ACCENT_CONTENT` - Text color used on the primary accent color
- `VITE_APP_SECONDARY` - Optional secondary theme color
- `VITE_APP_SECONDARY_CONTENT` - Text color used on the secondary color

Community, relay, and discovery defaults:

- `VITE_DEFAULT_COMMUNITY` - Optional recommended starting community as a canonical `kind:32222` definition `naddr`
- `VITE_INDEXER_RELAYS` - Optional comma-separated relay URLs used for discovery and community bootstrap
- `VITE_SIGNER_RELAYS` - Comma-separated relays used for NIP-46 signer discovery
- `VITE_DEFAULT_BLOSSOM_SERVERS` - Fallback Blossom media servers for uploads
- `VITE_SMART_WIDGET_RELAYS` - Optional widget discovery relays; app defaults are used when empty
- `VITE_DEFAULT_WIDGETS` - Optional comma-separated kind-30033 widget `naddr`s, added to community-owner defaults; works without a default community
- `VITE_TRUSTED_LIVE_STREAM_PROVIDER_PUBKEYS` - Optional comma-separated provider pubkeys allowed to identify community moderators as NIP-53 stream hosts; defaults to providers trusted by zap.stream

Git and optional services:

- `VITE_GIT_RELAYS` - Comma-separated Nostr relays used for Git repository discovery
- `VITE_GIT_DEFAULT_CORS_PROXY` - Default CORS proxy for Git HTTP operations
- `VITE_BURROW_URL` - Optional hosted email/password account service URL; empty hides those flows
- `VITE_BUILD_HASH` - Build hash shown in Settings > About and used by the service worker; usually injected by CI

Build-time feature flags:

- `FEATURE_GRASP` - Enables GRASP and Nostr Git paths unless set to `0`
- `FEATURE_CICD` - Enables experimental CI/CD hooks only when set to `1`
- The alternative issue/comment importer is disabled in all builds; `FEATURE_IMPORT_REPO` cannot enable it.

Development-only helpers:

- `VITE_DEV_ALLOWED_HOSTS` - Comma-separated hostnames allowed by the Vite dev server
- `VITE_DEV_HMR_*` - Optional HMR overrides for reverse-proxied development
- `VITE_DEV_CHII_TARGET_URL` - Optional Chii target script URL for mobile remote debugging

Production HTML and manifest placeholders are currently post-processed by `build.sh` from `VITE_PLATFORM_NAME`, `VITE_PLATFORM_SHORT_NAME`, `VITE_PLATFORM_DESCRIPTION`, `VITE_PLATFORM_ACCENT`, and `VITE_PLATFORM_URL`. Runtime app metadata and PWA asset generation use the `VITE_APP_*` keys above.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Cannot find module" errors**: If you encounter module resolution errors, try:

```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install

# Clear SvelteKit cache
rm -rf .svelte-kit
```

**Old checkout migration**: Current revisions have no Git submodules. If an old
checkout reports `not our ref` or untracked files blocking a rebase, follow the
[migration guide](CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-and-migrating-older-checkouts) before
crossing the template/core/UI conversions. A fresh plain clone of `dev` avoids
legacy submodule worktrees.

**Node.js version issues**: Ensure you're using the correct Node.js version:

```bash
# Check current version
node --version

# Switch to correct version if needed
nvm use lts/jod
```

**Sharp/libvips installation errors**: A system-installed libvips can trigger a
Sharp source build and a missing `node-gyp` error. Use the prebuilt binaries:

```bash
SHARP_IGNORE_GLOBAL_LIBVIPS=1 pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

The production install script already sets this variable.

## Development

See [./CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed development guidelines.

### Quick Start for Development

```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
pnpm dev

# Run type checking in watch mode
pnpm check:watch

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Format code
pnpm format
```

For widget development, use `pnpm dev:releases`, `pnpm dev:pipelines`, or
`pnpm dev:template` in another terminal. `pnpm build:extensions`,
`pnpm check:extensions`, and `pnpm test:extensions` cover the in-tree widgets and
template/SDK. Widget HTML is built separately from the host app; installing a
published Smart Widget still uses the normal extension flow.

For testing the dev server from a phone over a VPS tunnel (with remote console/network debugging, including ocmux profile setup), see `docs/ops/phone-dev-vps.md`.

### E2E (Playwright)

Install Playwright browsers (Chromium) used for E2E tests:

```bash
pnpm e2e:install
```

Run the E2E suite:

```bash
pnpm e2e
```

Optionally run in UI mode or headed mode:

```bash
pnpm e2e:ui
pnpm e2e:headed
```

Playwright will start (or reuse) the dev server at `http://127.0.0.1:1847`.

## Deployment

If you want the shortest path for running your own instance, read `docs/ops/self-hosting.md`.

To run your own Budabit instance, it's as simple as:

```sh
# Clone production and its package sources
git clone --branch master https://github.com/Pleb5/flotilla-budabit.git budabit
cd budabit

# Build for production (installs deps, rebuilds native modules, then runs build.sh)
pnpm run build-in-production

# Serve the built application
npx serve -s build
```

`build-in-production.sh` wraps the full production flow, including dependency install and native rebuilds.

For self-hosted updates without local source commits (branding can stay in `.env`):

```sh
git pull --ff-only
pnpm run build-in-production
```

For deployments with local commits or an old submodule layout, use the
[contributor update/migration procedure](CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-and-migrating-older-checkouts).

Or, if you prefer to use a container, build and run the local Dockerfile. The runtime image exposes port `1847` and honors `PORT`:

```sh
podman build -t budabit .
podman run -d -p 1847:1847 budabit
```

Alternatively, you can copy the build files into a directory of your choice and serve it yourself:

```sh
mkdir ./mount
podman create --name budabit-build budabit
podman cp budabit-build:/app/build/. ./mount/
podman rm budabit-build
```
